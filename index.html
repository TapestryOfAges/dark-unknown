      <p>Welcome to the Dark Unknown Demo v 1.02. To create this demo from the main game I 
        simply put a wall of force fields around the starting areas- you will have 
        some NPCs ask you to visit locations outside the wall, but those quests are
        outside the scope of the demo. You will basically have run through all of the 
        demo content when you have been rewarded for clearing the cave.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center">How to Play</h3>
      <p>Before you begin, you should read the <a href="Player Reference Guide.pdf">Player Reference Guide</a>.</p>
      <p>The keyboard commands are explained in detail there, but to refresh once you've read it, here is a 
        handy <a href="Player Reference Card-p1.pdf">Reference Card</a>.</p>
      <p>NOTE- the game does not use the mouse at all- even on the title screen all UI interaction is
        performed with the keyboard! To choose options on the title screen, use the up and down arrows and
        the Enter key.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to access the Dark Unknown demo- locally or remotely. Locally is recommended, but 
        involves downloading the game to your computer. Remotely allows you to play it from this server, but
        there will be noticeable load times for some music and graphics.</p>
      <p><u>Locally:</u></p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Download the demo <a href="Dark Unknown Demo.zip">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Unzip it and place it anywhere. Once you've started a game, don't move the Dark Unknown Demo folder-
          your saved games are linked to its location.</li>
        <li>Find and open "darkunknown.html" to launch the game.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p><u>Remotely</u></p>
      <p><ul><li>Click <a href="darkunknown.html">here!</a> NOTE: If there is no music, try reloading- the
       game is not yet optimized for remote play and the music can desync.</li></ul></p>
      <p>NOTE: At the moment, only Firefox is fully supported. Chrome recently started showing this weird bug
        where it would sometimes just not redraw the screen despite being told to, but otherwise has been fine.
        Edge does not support the uses I put localStorage to, and Safari and Opera are untested. Additionally,
        the Noscript addon seems to cause huge problems- without it, the game is pretty snappy, but with it 
        it takes several seconds between each command. It needs to be disabled entirely, not just told to 
        permit scripts on that one page.</p> 
      <h3 style="text-align:center">Bugs</h3>
      <p>There are no known bugs in the demo at this point, but that doesn't mean there aren't any. If you find 
        something that you think is a bug, please send an email to gf@tapestryofages.com with BUG in the subject
        line. If we are so lucky that your bug is reproducible, I'd love it if you would send me a saved game-
        use ctrl-Q to export your save file, and copy/paste it into the email. Please let me know what OS and 
        browser you are on, as well as what you were doing.</p>
      <h3>Afterwards</h3>
      <p>When you are done, there are two things I would very much appreciate you doing for me!</p>
      <p><ol><li>Before you close the browser tab you were playing in, hit Ctrl-S. This will pop open 
        another tab and put in it a log of all of the dialog from your run through. This will allow
        me to scan for keywords that people tend to expect responses to but don't give them.</li> 
        <li>Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EauwJgvI9aCYbO5p8hbmQ1gmZobZqSi9oTYcfLtYPm4">this survey!</a>
        Feel free to include keywords you think should be put into dialog responses and any other 
        examples of expectations that were not fulfilled.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p>Thank you and I hope you enjoy your stay in The Dark Unknown!</p>
