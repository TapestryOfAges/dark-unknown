<h2>Dark Unknown Map Editor v1.0</h2>

<p><a href="mapeditor.html">Go to the editor</a>.</p>

<p>A quick and dirty instruction file for using the map editor. Note: This requires Javascript to be turned on.</p>

<h3>Top Menu</h3>

<ul>
<li>Leftmost button (shows a triangle): Hide/reveal the rest of the interface. (To-do: move it up and off the top tiles a bit.)</li>
<li>New Map: Creates a 5x5 water map. Use the "resize" buttons in the upper right to create a map of the desired size. (To-do: Make "New Map"
ask for input about new map size.) New Map is the same as clicking "Load Map" with the "test" map selected.</li>
<li>Load Map: loads whichever map is selected in the dropdown. Be patient if the map is very large (like the "world" map).</li>
<li>Save Map: Opens a new window/tab and saves the JS for the map you are working on there. Use Save As to save it to disk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upper Right</h3>
<ul>
<li>The square shows which tile you are "painting" with.</li>
<li>Resize: Select one of the 9 boxes to show where in your new map the current map should be anchored. Same as in Photoshop/whatever when
changing canvas size. If you choose the middle left box and then add columns they will all be added to the right, etc.</li>
<li>Debug: Turns on the debug code, which pops info into a separate window. You are unlikely to want to do this. What stuff appears there is
by and large dependant on which bits of code were giving me strange errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Right Column</h3>

<ul>
<li>Choose which category of tiles to choose from: Outdoor or Indoor for terrain, or Features. (Creatures is not yet implemented.)</li>
<li>Click any of the tiles to select that tile to add to the map. You can see the tilenames in the status bar on the browser as you mouseover.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bottom Menu</h3>

<ul>
<li>Point/Rectangle: If "Point" is selected, each click places one tile. If "rectangle" is selected, the first click is one corner, and the
second click the opposite corner. The map will then fill in all the squares in the rectangle (which you can of course also use to make lines).
</li>
<li>Base Map/Features: Switching to Base Map redraws the map without any of the features showing. Selecting Features redraws it with the 
features. Note this does a lazy redraw of the entire map, so it's slower the larger the map is.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features vs Terrain:</h3>
<p>Terrain is anything totally immutable and unusable on the map. Grass, mountains, walls, floors. Pillars and fountains if you don't want the
PC to be able to (U)se the fountain. <br />
Features are placed on top of terrain and are things like cities, dungeon entrances, doors, chairs, etc. <br />
When making a map make it first as just terrain and then add the features.</p>

<h3>How to save a map to edit later:</h3>
<p>JavaScript doesn't have the ability to modify files on your hard drive. Hitting Save Map will open a new window and print the JS code for your
map there. Perform the following steps if you want to be able to later Load the map you've built:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save Map. Give it a unique name.</li>
<li>Go to the window with the map JS code and select File->Save As. Save it in the maps/ directory of the editor. (Note: you can only save a 
map to reload later when running the editor locally. If you just want to send me the built map, save it anywhere and email it to me.)</li>
<li>Open the file mapeditor.html. Find the comment "Maps follow" and add the following line at the end of that block:<br />
<code>&lt;script language="JavaScript" src="maps/YOURFILENAME"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>
<li>Reload the map editor (hit refresh on the page). Your map should now appear in the dropdown next to Load Maps.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your map is complete and you would like to offer it to me for use in The Dark Unknown, send me the file after you Save As.</p>
